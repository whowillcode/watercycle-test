# Ice

Incorrect Answer.

Water present in _liquid water_ form (in plants and on surface) evaporates as _water vapor_ and rises into atmosphere. There it condenses to form clouds. The clouds then give out rain (_liquid water_) or snow & hail (_ice_) which falls back to earth. So all forms of water are present in water cycle

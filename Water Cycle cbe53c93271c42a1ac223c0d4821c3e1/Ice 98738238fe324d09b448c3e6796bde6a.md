Water present in *liquid water* form (in plants and on surface) evaporates as *water vapor* and rises into atmosphere. There it condenses to form clouds. The clouds then give out rain (*liquid water*) or snow & hail (*ice*) which falls back to earth. So all forms of water are present in water cycle

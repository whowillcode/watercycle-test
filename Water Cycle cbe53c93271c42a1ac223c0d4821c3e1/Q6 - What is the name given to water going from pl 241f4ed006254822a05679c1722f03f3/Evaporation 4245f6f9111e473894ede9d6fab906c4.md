# Evaporation

Incorrect Answer

1. Evaporation is the conversion of water on the surface (oceans, rivers, lakes etc.) into water vapour which rises up.
2. Precipitation is when clouds give up the water vapour that falls to ground either as rain or snow/hail.
- Condensation is when water vapour that rises up starts to form small droplets and combine to become clouds in the sky.
